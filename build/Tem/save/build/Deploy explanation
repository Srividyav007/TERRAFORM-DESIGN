Detailed Step-by-Step Explanation of the Project: Deploying Medusa on AWS ECS with Fargate and Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions
This project involves deploying Medusa, an open-source headless commerce platform, on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) using Fargate, and automating the deployment with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the entire process:
Set Up AWS Infrastructure Using Terraform
In this step, we will use Terraform to provision the necessary AWS resources such as VPC, subnets, ECS cluster, and more.

// Install Terraform
If you haven't installed Terraform, you'll need to do so. Follow the installation steps from the official Terraform documentation.

1.2. Create a Terraform Configuration File
You will define the infrastructure you need (VPC, ECS, security groups, etc.) in a main.tf file. Hereâ€™s a simplified example of the Terraform configuration for the Medusa backend
This main.tf file defines
VPC and Subnet for network isolation.

Security Groups to allow HTTP traffic on port 80.

ECS Cluster and ECS Service to deploy the Medusa backend as a Docker container using AWS Fargate.

IAM Roles for ECS task execution.

// Initialize Terraform and Apply Configuration
To apply the configuration:
Dockerize the Medusa Backend
Now that we have our infrastructure ready, let's create a Docker container for the Medusa backend.

//Create a Dockerfile for Medusa
Create a Dockerfile in your repository to define how to build the Medusa backend Docker image

This Dockerfile does the following:

Uses the Node.js image as a base.

Copies package.json and installs dependencies.

Copies the Medusa source code into the container.

Exposes port 80 for HTTP traffic.

Starts the Medusa backend app.

// Build and  the Docker Image Locally

Set Up CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions
//Create GitHub Actions Workflow

In your GitHub repository, create a .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file to define your CI/CD pipeline.
This file will build and push the Docker image to ECR, then update the ECS service.
//git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Medusa backend to ECS"
git push origin main//
//

Verify the Deployment
Check the status of your GitHub Actions workflow to ensure it completes successfully.

Visit the ECS Console to verify that the ECS service has been updated with the new Docker image.

Access your Medusa backend via the public IP or domain name provided by AWS//
//


Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to:

Use Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure on AWS (VPC, subnets, ECS, etc.).

Dockerize the Medusa backend.

Push the Docker image to AWS ECR.

Automate the deployment using GitHub Actions
