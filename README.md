Detailed Step-by-Step Explanation of the Project: Deploying Medusa on AWS ECS with Fargate and Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions
This project involves deploying Medusa, an open-source headless commerce platform, on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) using Fargate, and automating the deployment with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the entire process:
Set Up AWS Infrastructure Using Terraform
In this step, we will use Terraform to provision the necessary AWS resources such as VPC, subnets, ECS cluster, and more.

// Install Terraform
If you haven't installed Terraform, you'll need to do so. Follow the installation steps from the official Terraform documentation.

1.2. Create a Terraform Configuration File
You will define the infrastructure you need (VPC, ECS, security groups, etc.) in a main.tf file. Hereâ€™s a simplified example of the Terraform configuration for the Medusa backend
This main.tf file defines
VPC and Subnet for network isolation.

Security Groups to allow HTTP traffic on port 80.

ECS Cluster and ECS Service to deploy the Medusa backend as a Docker container using AWS Fargate.

IAM Roles for ECS task execution.
