 Deploying Medusa on AWS ECS with Fargate and Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions
This project involves deploying Medusa, an open-source headless commerce platform, on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) using Fargate, and automating the deployment with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the entire process:
Set Up AWS Infrastructure Using Terraform
In this step, we will use Terraform to provision the necessary AWS resources such as VPC, subnets, ECS cluster, and more.

The purpose of the above project is to automate the deployment and scaling of the Medusa headless commerce platform on AWS using modern DevOps practices.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main objectives:

1. Deploy Medusa on Scalable Infrastructure
Medusa is an open-source headless commerce engine.

Hosting it on AWS ECS Fargate allows you to run it in a serverless, containerized environment without managing servers.

Fargate scales automatically, reducing operational overhead.

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
Using Terraform to define AWS infrastructure makes your environment:

Version-controlled

Reproducible

Consistent across environments (dev/stage/prod)

3. Automated CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
Automatically build and push Docker images to Amazon ECR on code changes.

Deploy the updated container to ECS Fargate with zero manual steps.

Ensures faster, reliable deployments and reduces human errors.

4. Cost-Efficiency and Flexibility
ECS Fargate is pay-as-you-go, which is cost-effective for small to medium-sized businesses.

Containerization allows you to easily move or update Medusa without vendor lock-in.

5. Real-World Use Case
This kind of setup is perfect for:

Startups or businesses building a headless e-commerce store.

Developers looking to learn cloud-native deployment and DevOps.

Teams wanting a production-ready commerce backend with CI/CD
